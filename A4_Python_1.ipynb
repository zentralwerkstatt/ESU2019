    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",

    "These are the reasons why we and many machine learning researchers have chosen Python for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will very loosely follow the official Python 3.7 tutorial which is available [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). This document, however, will only contain/link to the parts of the language that we explicitly discuss in class.\n",

    "Python is a well-documented language. Everything you need to know about the core language is in the official [docs](https://docs.python.org/3), and everything you need to know about the few libraries we will actively use can be found in their respective docs."

Fortunately, as we are using the Anaconda distribution and are working inside an environment, this is easy. Simply install the respective package in your environment and then run `import package`. For packages that are used really frequently in the code, you can also change the name to something shorter with the `as` keyword, for instance: `import torchvision as tv`. You can also import only parts of a package with the `from` keyword."

    "\n",
    "While the technical reality is a bit more complicated, we can regard variables as *signs that holds values*. In Python, we can assign a value to a sign with the equality operator: `a = 1`. Variables can hold many different kinds of values, integers (`a = 1`), floating point numbers (`a = 1.5`), words (`a = 'foo'`), truth values (`True`or `False`) vectors, matrices, or even complicated structures made up of many different kinds of values. Python also offers built-in support for more complex data types, for instance (literally) complex numbers (a = 3+2j`) or very large/small numbers in scientific notation (a = 2e-10`). However, Python is a [weakly-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) language. In practice, this means that we do not have to tell the interpreter what kind of value we are assigning to a sign, it will infer this for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different way to \"look into\" a variable, i.e. see what value it is holding at a certain point in the execution of the program. A very easy way is to just print its value to the console/notebook. In Python, we use the `print` function for this purpose: `print(a)`."
